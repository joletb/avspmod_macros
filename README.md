# avspmod_macros

A couple of AvsPmod macros that I use from time to time, uploaded mostly in case I somehow accidentally lose them.

**SCFreezeBackward** - Freezeframes the current frame to the previous one, useful when dealing with dirty scenechanges.  
**SCFreezeForward** - Same as previous but freezeframes to the next frame.  
**StrangeToTrim** - Outputs [strange()](https://www.animemusicvideos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=107160) ranges to trims for easy checking of filtered sections.  
**TrimStart** - Sets the starting point of a trimmed section.  
**TrimFinish** - Sets the ending point of a trimmed section.  
**TrimEnd** - Sets the ending point of a trimmed section ***and*** adds a ++ operator for joining trims.
